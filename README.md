# Web Application Development

### My first microservice
Microservice architecture based web applications

#### REST-API and Servers:
- Python (Flask), Docker

#### Style and appearance
- HTML, CSS


#### REST-API with Swagger-UI

## Dockerize the application

To operate as a microservice, the application should be dockerized for better deployment possibilities. The application can be run in a simple python environment including `flask` and `cowsay` packages. These packages should be included in the `requirements.txt` file.
The Dockerfile specifies the environment and the `docker-compose.yml` is used to set up the infrastructure.

`docker-compose build`
`docker-compose up`
